PROTOTYPE FIXES

** help with error messages?

** how to avoid reattaching the listeners?

** improvement on the presentation of types?

** fix subtyping and equals algorithms? how to test?

PROTOTYPE:

1. Examples should use initial empty line to not show typing info.
2. Rethink interface.
3. How to show multiple levels of same capability?

remember to disable Chrome's cache!
?worker=false for debugging...

========================================

LOWER PRIORITY: 
 - organize type error messages, as CONSTANTS? / FUNCTIONS?
 - Program assertions != Type Errors / Interpreter Errors
 - pass assert function instead of 'ast'?

TODO?

# Notes on typing algorithm:
 - try to stack all "touched" capabilities at the end of a function.
 - check that OPEN does not produce a resulting environment/type that
 depends on scoped types.
 - packing up to subtyping, instead of equals?
 maybe allow manually to apply subtyping? (e : A)?
 list example would be made slightly simpler, maybe?

# ensure location variables cannot be hidden, or renamed.
	If the variable is hidden it may cause leaks, rename is always possible
	anyway...

# IDIOT YOU ARE USING RECURSION WHEN WHILE IS ENOUGH

# stacking alternatives:
 - other alternatives must be invalid, or there could be duplication of caps.
 - improve mergin so that differences are grouped in *-type and then (+). This
 	will then allow merging environments with different caps.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Some ideas for improvements:
	
2. Non-syntax directed alternative open.
	Currently the typechecker requires a "@p E" to know precisely where an
	alternative should be broken down into its separate bits. However, this is
	just a simplification since the typechecker could employ a search algorithm
	to check all possible different alternatives until finding one that checks
	such code. (this is decidable since there is a finite number of expressions
	and the alternatives also list a finite number of elements)

3. Define convenient parsing priorities (to recude use of parenthesis).
	This is needed, but boring, since it is not all that clear which changes
	will potentially cause conflicts in the grammar making this a try-fail
	change...
	Grammar should probably allow:
 		fun( x : ... ) . e := 2
 	to work directly? What are some convenient priorities?

4. Syntax sugar for multi-open?
	open < a, < b, < c , < d , x > > > > = x in ... end
	
===============================================================================

REMEMBER:
 	- to disable chrome's cache
 	- launch 'static' on trunk/

CODE STYLE:
 	--- ALWAYS USE IDENTITY === and !==
	- use 'instanceof' instead of has property 'ast' for errors
	+ use finally for exceptions?
	- CONSTANTS ARE CAPPED
	- console.debug for debug messages
	- console.error for error messages, it prints stack trace!
	- https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console
	- convention: "fake" protected/private fields using $NAME
