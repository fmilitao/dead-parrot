TODO:
 	test-ok12.txt can only be readded once recursion is typing.
	-- multi-open and multi-pack syntax sugar? use arrays of stuff
	open <a,b,c,d,x> = <p,q,X, ... >

	
======================

- location variables cannot be hidden, or renamed
- try to stack all "touched" capabilities at the end of a method.

- Typing algorithm:
	- name collisions should not be allowed, no crap about hidding.
(if the variable is hidden it may cause leaks)... renaming is
always possible anyway.

- check that OPEN does not produce a resulting environment/type that
depends on scoped types.
	
========================================

LOW PRIORITY:
 - define when parentesis are needed in toHTML
 - define better parsing priorities to reduce use of parenthesis.
 	"fun( x ) . e := 2" should work directly, maybe?
 	might be messy to do with the share construct.

CODE STYLE:
	- use 'instanceof' instead of has prorperty ast for errors
	+ use finally for exceptions?
	- CONSTANTS ARE CAPPED
	- console.debug for debug messages
	- console.error for error messages, it prints stack trace!
