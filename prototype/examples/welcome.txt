/* WELCOME!

 Dead-Parrot is an experimental prototype implementation of the language from
 "Substructural Typestates" and was written entirely in javascript. It should
 run directly in a modern web-browser (Google Chrome preferred).

 Parsing and typechecking errors should be flagged on-the-fly.

 NOTES:
  - allows C-style comments.
  - the languages uses a few idioms for convenience (see idioms example).
  - parsing priorities are a bit messy...
