/* WELCOME! (alpha version, NOT FEATURE COMPLETE)

 Dead-Parrot is a prototype implementation of our language written entirely
 in javascript and should run directly in any modern web-browser.

 Parsing and typechecking errors should be flagged automatically.
 Visit the project page for more details on libraries used, etc.

 NOTES:
  - allows C-style comments.
  - the languages uses a few IDIOMS for convenience (see idioms example).
  - examples files are fetched dynamically (AJAX), may be slow.
